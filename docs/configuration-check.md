# Configuration

Final steps : login to docker and ensure it is working !

### Docker Pull

It's time to ensure, you have the correct access rights to pull the frontend image.

First change the `FRONTEND_IMAGE_TAG` uses by the frontend service :

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml" hl_lines="2"
  frontend:
    image: registry.gitlab.com/r2devops/frontend:$FRONTEND_IMAGE_TAG
```

Then paste this command : 
```bash
docker login https://registry.gitlab.com/v2/r2devops
```

With the below information:

- username: `r2devops`
- password: `REGISTRY_TOKEN`


??? info "Where should I find them ?"
    `REGISTRY_TOKEN` and `FRONTEND_IMAGE_TAG` have been send to you by email at the [beginning](/).  

### Launch the application


!!! success "Congratulations"
    You have successfully installed R2Devops on your server üéâ  
    Now you can launch the application and ensure everything works as expected.

Go inside the folder `self-hosted` and launch the following command :
```bash
docker compose --env-file=local.env up -d
```
??? failure "I get a `docker compose` error"
    Make sure you are pasting the right token!

    Otherwise write a mail to [tech@r2devops.io](mailto:tech@r2devops.io) and ask him a `read_registry` token for the frontend


The terminal will start all services, you can ensure that they are all running :

```

You can now proceed to final checks !

### Checks

Here is a quick gif showing actions to realize to ensure the application is working as excepted :

*The GIF showing the steps to ensure everything is working*

### Detailed steps : 

This is the last step, to ensure your R2Devops instance is fully configured.

Open your browser and go to the `FRONTEND_URL` you have set in the `local.env` file.

Open `Get started` to create your account and click with on `Continue with GitLab`. 

Authorize the application to access your GitLab account.

You should directly be redirected to the website.

The application will then ask for a GitLab Token with `read_api` scope.

Go to your GitLab profile, then go to `Settings > Access Tokens` and click on `Create personal access token`.

Then paste the token in the form and click and submit.

You should now be able to use R2Devops ! Check if you have your organization in the `Organization` menu.
