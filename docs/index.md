# Self-hosted R2Devops documentation


This documentation will describe you with simple steps how to self-host your own R2Devops instance ü§ñ.

???+ important "Before starting"
    In order to have a functional instance of R2Devops, some customization of the frontend applications are needed on our side before you can deploy it.  

    üëâ To do so, you need to tell us which domain name you will use for the application.  

    üìî Please check the section about [Domain name](/configuration-domain/#about-records) to fully understand our needs.

    üì® Then write a mail to [tech@r2devops.io](mailto:tech@r2devops.io) specifying them.


???+ note "What you will need from us for the setup"
     When you send us the domain name you will use, we will provide you the following :
     
     - `REPOSITORY_TOKEN` : a token to access the repository
     - `REGISTRY_TOKEN` : a token to authenticate to our private registry
     - `FRONTEND_IMAGE_TAG` : a specific tag for the frontend image

     Keep those information safe, you will need them later.

     ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important** : We won"t save the tokens, so please keep them private and in a safer place.
